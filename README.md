# target-ducklake

`target-ducklake` is a Singer target for ducklake. This target is in development and may not be stable. I built this with GCS in mind, but it should work with S3 and local storage, though this has not been tested extensively.

Supports append, merge, and overwrite load methods (default is merge). The load method can be configured using the `load_method` setting. If no key properties are provided and `overwrite_if_no_pk` is true, data will be overwritten. Otherwise, the configured load method determines the behavior.

## TODOs

- support deleting data from the target or setting _sdc_deleted_at field (example use-case: syncing from Postgres using log-based change data capture)

## Configuration

### Accepted Config Options

| Setting | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|---------|------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `catalog_url` | string | ✅ | - | URL connection string to your catalog database |
| `data_path` | string | ✅ | - | GCS, S3, or local folder path for data storage |
| `storage_type` | string | ✅ | `"local"` | Type of storage: GCS, S3, or local |
| `catalog_type` | string | ✅ | `"postgres"` | Type of catalog database: postgres, sqlite, mysql, or duckdb. See <https://ducklake.select/docs/stable/duckdb/usage/choosing_a_catalog_database> |
| `meta_schema` | string | ❌ | - | Schema name in the catalog database to use for Ducklake metadata tables. If not provided will use the default schema for the catalog database (eg `public` for Postgres) |
| `public_key` | string | ❌ | - | Public key for private GCS and S3 storage authentication (optional) |
| `secret_key` | string | ❌ | - | Secret key for private GCS and S3 storage authentication (optional) |
| `region` | string | ❌ | - | AWS region for S3 storage type (required when using S3 with explicit credentials) |
| `default_target_schema` | string | ❌ | - | Default database schema where data should be written. If not provided schema will attempt to be inferred from the stream name (inferring schema only works for database extractors ) |
| `target_schema_prefix` | string | ❌ | - | Prefix to add to the target schema name. If not provided, no prefix will be added |
| `add_record_metadata` | boolean | ❌ | `false` | When True, automatically adds Singer Data Capture (SDC) metadata columns to target tables |
| `hard_delete` | boolean | ❌ | `false` | When True, `ACTIVATE_VERSION` deletes rows absent from the activated version; when False, it sets their `_sdc_deleted_at`. See [Overwrite and ACTIVATE_VERSION](#overwrite-and-activate_version). |
| `process_activate_version_messages` | boolean | ❌ | `true` | When False, `ACTIVATE_VERSION` messages are ignored. |
| `load_method` | string | ❌ | `"merge"` | Method to use for loading data into the target table: append, merge, or overwrite. See [Overwrite and ACTIVATE_VERSION](#overwrite-and-activate_version). |
| `flatten_max_level` | integer | ❌ | `0` | Maximum depth for flattening nested fields. Set to 0 to disable flattening |
| `temp_file_dir` | string | ❌ | `"temp_files/"` | Directory path for storing temporary parquet files |
| `max_batch_size` | integer | ❌ | `10000` | Maximum number of records to process in a single batch |
| `partition_fields` | object | ❌ | - | Object mapping stream names to arrays of partition column definitions. Each stream key maps directly to an array of column definitions |
| `auto_cast_timestamps` | boolean | ❌ | `false` | When True, automatically attempts to cast timestamp-like fields to timestamp types in ducklake |
| `convert_tz_to_utc` | boolean | ❌ | `false` | When True, converts timezone-aware date-time values to UTC before loading, so a timestamp column without time zone stores the UTC time. When False, such a column stores each value's local wall-clock time (its offset is dropped). With the default, a timestamp column fed values in different offsets holds local times that aren't directly comparable; turn this on, or declare the column `timestamptz` (via `x-sql-datatype`), to compare instants. Either way, a `timestamptz` column stores the correct instant, and values with any offset, such as `+05:30`, load. Values without a time zone are loaded as given; a `timestamptz` column reads them in the DuckDB session's time zone. |
| `validate_records` | boolean | ❌ | `false` | Whether to validate the schema of the incoming streams |
| `overwrite_if_no_pk` | boolean | ❌ | `false` | When True, a stream without primary keys replaces the target table's rows, as `load_method: overwrite` does. Overrides load_method. |
| `max_column_length` | integer | ❌ | `63` | Maximum length for column names. Only applied when `catalog_type` is `postgres`. Names exceeding this limit are truncated. Colliding truncated names get a `_{i}` suffix. Set to `0` to disable. See [ducklake#619](https://github.com/duckdb/ducklake/issues/619). |
| `parallel_draining` | boolean | ❌ | `true` | When True, enables parallel draining with `max_parallelism=10` (Meltano default). When False, sets `max_parallelism=1` to disable parallel draining. Ignored when `catalog_type` is `sqlite`: SQLite allows one writer at a time, so its sinks are always drained one at a time (a log line says so). |
| `max_record_age_minutes` | number | ❌ | `10.0` | Maximum age in minutes that records can sit in a sink before a drain is forced. Tune lower for more frequent flushes, higher for larger batches. |

```

### Partitioning and sort order

Each stream's table layout is set with `stream_defaults` (every stream) and `stream_overrides` (keyed by stream name, merged over the defaults key by key). This is the same shape as target-iceberg, so both targets can be configured alike:

```yaml
stream_defaults:
  sort_order: [updated_at]
stream_overrides:
  orders:
    partition:
      - {column: occurred_at, transform: day}
      - {column: tenant_id, transform: bucket, num_buckets: 16}
    sort_order: [customer_id, "occurred_at DESC NULLS LAST"]
```

- **`partition`:** a list of `{column, transform}` entries. Transforms are `identity` (the default), `year`, `month`, `day`, `hour` and `bucket`, in lowercase as in target-iceberg and Zamboni (`Day` is refused); `bucket` requires `num_buckets`.
- **`sort_order`:** column names, each optionally followed by `ASC`/`DESC` and `NULLS FIRST`/`NULLS LAST`. DuckLake writes each new file's rows in this order.
- **Column names** are the table's (flattened names use `__`), matched case-insensitively. An unknown key, transform or column fails the stream with a message naming it, rather than being ignored.
- **When applied:** a new table gets the layout at creation. On an existing table, a changed layout is applied as metadata, and files written afterwards follow it (unlike target-iceberg, where partitioning is fixed at creation). An unchanged layout is left alone. A stream with no `partition` or `sort_order` keeps whatever layout its table already has; an empty list (`partition: []`, `sort_order: []`) removes the table's keys.
- **`table_config`:** the path to a Zamboni `table-config.json`, the file target-iceberg reads. Tables are matched case-insensitively, then by target-iceberg's conformed name (`Orders Daily` → `orders_daily`); a table with no block takes `defaults` (logged), so a `defaults.partition` must name columns every stream has, as in target-iceberg. The file must be version 2 (`namespaces.<ns>.tables.<table>`), the format Zamboni reads; the namespace is the target schema. The version 1 shape (top-level `tables` keyed `namespace.table`) and any other `version` are refused, since Zamboni refuses them too. A table's `partition` sets its partition keys, and an `ordering` with `mode: sort` (`[{column, direction, nulls}]`) sets its sort order (`mode: none`, the default, removes it); an ordering Zamboni would refuse is refused too: a `sort` list or `zorder` block without the matching `mode`, both at once, an empty `sort`, an unknown key in a sort entry, or a direction or nulls value other than lowercase `asc`/`desc` and `first`/`last`. A missing `warehouse` is not checked, since target-ducklake doesn't use it. Maintenance-only keys (`retention`, `partition_evolution`, …) are ignored, and keys target-ducklake doesn't know are logged, not rejected. The format is pinned to Zamboni's published spec: `tests/contracts/` holds a copy from a Zamboni tag, refreshed by `bin/refresh-table-config-contract.sh`, and `tests/test_table_config_contract.py` fails if the reader and the spec disagree on a key, transform, ordering mode or version. A key in the table's block wins over `defaults`, and lists replace whole, as in Zamboni. A stream's own `partition` and `sort_order` win over the file, and the file wins over `partition_fields`.

**Configs shared with target-iceberg.** A config written for target-iceberg works here. What only configures Iceberg is accepted and ignored with a log line at startup:
- `delete_strategy` and `merge_on_read_maintenance_acknowledged` (DuckLake deletes always write delete files, i.e. merge-on-read; compaction is maintenance);
- `on_error` without `type_source`, which it alone applies to (target-iceberg injects `on_error: raise` into `stream_defaults`);
- a partition `name`;
- the `truncate` and `void` transforms (that entry is skipped);
- `ordering` with `mode: zorder`;
- the table config's maintenance sections (`partition_evolution`, `retention`, sizing, …), `warehouse` and `version`.

If skipping `truncate`/`void` leaves no partition key, the partition counts as not configured, so an existing table's partitioning is not reset by accident.

Settings that would change what data is loaded are **rejected** until implemented, never ignored:
- `write_mode` and `key_properties` (DUCKLKD-41);
- `type_source`, with any `on_error` (DUCKLKD-43).

target-iceberg ignores `write_mode`, and silently appends where upsert was meant. Unknown keys, unknown transforms and columns the stream lacks are rejected too. Column names may be given in full where a Postgres catalog truncates them to 63 characters.

- **Checked at startup:** the `stream_defaults`/`stream_overrides` settings of every stream, and every table's layout sections in `table_config`, are checked when the target starts (a missing or invalid file fails here). Column names, and the older `partition_fields`, are checked when each stream's schema arrives.
- **Both settings can be given as JSON strings** (for environment variables).

The older `partition_fields` setting still works for a stream without a `partition`:

```json
{
    "stream_name": [
        {"column_name": "created_at", "type": "timestamp", "granularity": ["year", "month"]},
        {"column_name": "status", "type": "identifier"}
    ]
}
```

A full list of supported settings and capabilities for this
target is available by running:

```bash
target-ducklake --about
```

### Column types

Each property's JSON Schema type and format give its column type: `integer` is BIGINT (INTEGER with 32-bit bounds), `number` is DECIMAL(38, 9) (or its `precision`/`scale`), `boolean` is BOOLEAN, `object` and `array` are JSON, and `string` is VARCHAR, or DATE, TIME, TIMESTAMP or UUID by its `format`. A property declaring several non-null types, such as `["integer", "string"]`, is VARCHAR, and each value is stored as its text (`5`, `1.50`, `true`). Values are staged at their column's own type, so any value a column can hold loads, and one it can't hold fails the batch instead of being changed.

An `x-sql-datatype` annotation (as database taps emit, e.g. `smallint`, `numeric(12,4)`, `timestamptz`, `uuid`, `jsonb`) sets the column type instead, when the property's values can be loaded into it:

- a `string` property takes any supported hint, so `"12.5"` loads into a `numeric(12,4)` column;
- an `integer`, `number` or `boolean` property takes numeric hints and `json`/`jsonb`;
- an `object` or `array` property takes only `json`/`jsonb`.

Any other hint, such as `uuid` on an integer, is ignored with a warning, and the JSON type decides the column. Unsupported hints are ignored with the SDK's warning.

Supported hints (case and spacing ignored):

| Hint | Column type |
| --- | --- |
| `smallint`, `int2` / `integer`, `int`, `int4`, `mediumint` / `bigint`, `int8` | SMALLINT / INTEGER / BIGINT |
| MySQL `int(11)`, `bigint(20)` (display width ignored) | as without the width |
| `smallint unsigned`, `mediumint unsigned` / `int unsigned` / `bigint unsigned` | INTEGER / BIGINT / DECIMAL(20, 0) |
| `real`, `float4`, `float(p≤24)` / `float`, `float8`, `double`, `double precision`, `float(p>24)` (MySQL's `unsigned` ignored) | REAL / DOUBLE |
| `decimal(p,s)`, `numeric(p,s)`; `decimal(p)` (MySQL's `unsigned` ignored) | DECIMAL(p, s), capped at 38 digits; DECIMAL(p, 0) |
| `decimal`, `numeric` (no size) | DECIMAL(38, 9), or the property's `precision`/`scale` (so at most 29 integer digits) |
| `timestamp`, `timestamp without time zone`, `timestamp_ntz`, `datetime2`, `smalldatetime` | TIMESTAMP |
| `timestamptz`, `timestamp with time zone`, `timestamp_tz`, `timestamp_ltz`, `datetimeoffset` | TIMESTAMPTZ |
| `date` / `time`, `time without time zone` | DATE / TIME |
| any of the timestamp and time hints with a precision, e.g. `timestamp(3) with time zone` | as without it: microseconds are kept, so `datetime2(7)`'s 100 ns digit is dropped |
| `uuid`, `uniqueidentifier` / `json`, `jsonb` | UUID / JSON |

Hints naming the type a property gets anyway are accepted without a warning: a text type (`text`, `varchar(n)`, `varchar(max)`, `char(n)`, `nvarchar(n)`, `citext`) on a `string` property, and `boolean`/`bool` on a `boolean` property. On another JSON type they warn as unsupported. Deliberately unsupported, so they keep the JSON type's column: `tinyint` (MySQL uses `tinyint(1)` for booleans), `datetime` (MySQL's meaning is the opposite of ISO's), `timetz` and `time with time zone` (DuckLake's Parquet files drop the offset without converting it), `bit` and binary types.

Existing tables keep their column types, apart from safe integer and float widenings. Values are staged at an existing column's own type where the stream's type would change them: a number column into an existing DECIMAL, REAL or DOUBLE column, a whole-number decimal (such as `bigint unsigned`) into an existing integer column, and a string property into an existing text column, whose text is kept as sent whatever its hint. So a `double` hint on a column that already exists as DECIMAL(38, 9) still stores DECIMAL(38, 9) values: `1.5e-12` is stored as 0, and a warning reports how many values were rounded. Recreate the column to store doubles.

### Overwrite and ACTIVATE_VERSION

**Overwrite** (`load_method: overwrite`, or `overwrite_if_no_pk` for a stream without primary keys) replaces the table's rows atomically. Each batch is staged as a Parquet file in `temp_file_dir`, and at the end of the stream one transaction deletes the old rows and inserts every staged batch. Readers see the old table until that commit. A run that fails or is interrupted in the target leaves the old rows in place. Some limits:
- **STATE is held** while any overwrite stream hasn't committed: mid-run drains don't emit it, so a resumable tap can't skip rows that were never loaded. It is emitted after the commit. STATE is one message for all streams, so other streams' checkpoints wait too. After a crash during a long overwrite, they resume from their last emitted STATE.
- **The swap happens at the end of the input.** If the tap dies but its output ends cleanly, the target swaps in what it received.
- **`temp_file_dir` needs room for the whole stream,** not one batch.
- **A stream with no records still empties the table,** as before.
- **A schema change mid-stream** (a new SCHEMA for the stream) fails the run at the end, with the old rows intact.

**ACTIVATE_VERSION**, as full-table taps send it, retires rows that are gone at the source. The tap tags each record with a table version, then sends `ACTIVATE_VERSION` for that version. The target first loads any buffered records, then handles every row whose `_sdc_table_version` is not the activated version, including rows loaded without a version:
- **By default,** as in the Singer SDK, it sets their `_sdc_deleted_at` to the current UTC time and keeps them. A row the source sends again is revived when it is next loaded.
- **With `hard_delete: true`,** it deletes them.

Some cases retire nothing:
- **Without `add_record_metadata`:** records carry no version, so the message is ignored with a warning.
- **A version announced before any of its records** (as taps do at the start of a sync) is a no-op, so the table never empties mid-sync. A second `ACTIVATE_VERSION` for the same version, even with no records between, ends the sync: the source is empty, and every row is retired.
- **An overwrite stream** ignores versions, since it replaces the whole table anyway.

Between a sync's first batch and its `ACTIVATE_VERSION`, readers see the new rows next to rows of the old version. Set `process_activate_version_messages: false` to ignore the message entirely.

### Ducklake Schema Migration From 0.1 to 0.2
Solution to this issue: https://github.com/duckdb/ducklake/issues/240
The SQL to manually migrate your catalog schema (assuming Postgres) can be found in the `schema_migration.sql` file.

### Configure using environment variables

This Singer target will automatically import any environment variables within the working directory's
`.env` if the `--config=ENV` is provided, such that config values will be considered if a matching
environment variable is set either in the terminal context or in the `.env` file.
